# Yelp Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Yelp restaurant reviews to identify key factors contributing to positive and negative ratings, explore relationships between reviews, tipping behavior, and overall ratings, and compare trends across Florida (FL) and Pennsylvania (PA). The focus is on restaurants serving American, Chinese, and Italian cuisine.

**Data Sources**
Yelp Dataset: https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/

We created filtered CSV files after processing the original JSON files to include only our required data:

- Filtered for restaurants in FL and PA serving American, Chinese, and Italian cuisine

- Resulting filtered CSV files:

  - F_filtered_business.csv

  - F_filtered_review.csv

  - F_filtered_user.csv

  - F_filtered_tip.csv

These filtered CSV files were used for all subsequent analyses in our project.
